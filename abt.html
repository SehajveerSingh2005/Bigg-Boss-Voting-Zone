    <h1 class="t2">ABOUT</h1>
    <p>  <h3>CONCEPT</h3>
        Bigg Boss is a reality show based on the original Dutch Big Brother format developed by John de Mol. A number of contestants (known as "housemates") live in a purpose-built house and are isolated from the rest of the world. Each week, housemates nominate two of their peers for eviction, and the housemates who receive the most nominations would face a public vote. Of these, one would eventually leave, having been "evicted" from the House. However, there were exceptions to this process as dictated by Bigg Boss. In the final week, there were three/four/five housemates remaining, and the public voted for whom they wanted to win. The housemates in the Indian version are primarily celebrities with the exception of one who is a non-celebrity selected via auditions. However, Season 10–12 saw the addition of commoners on a great scale, with all 3 seasons featuring commoner finalists and Manveer winning Season 10. Housemates are overseen by a mysterious person known as 'Bigg Boss', whose only presence in the house is through his voice.<br>
       <h3>HOUSE</h3> 
A Bigg Boss house is built for every season. The house was earlier located in the tourist place of Lonavla, Pune district of Maharashtra. However, the house for the fifth season was located at ND Studios in Karjat. The house from the thirteenth season onwards was located in Film City, Goregaon, Mumbai.[3][4] The house is well-furnished and decorated and has many modern amenities, It consists of a kitchen, living area, 1-4 bedrooms and four toilet bathrooms. There is a storeroom, garden, pool, activity area and gym in the house. There is also a Confession Room, where the housemates may be called in by Bigg Boss for any kind of conversation, and for the nomination process.

The house has no TV connection, no telephones, no Internet connection, clocks, books, pen or paper.

  <h3>RULES</h3>R
  While all the rules have never been told to the audience, the most prominent ones are clearly seen. The inmates are not permitted to talk in any other language than Hindi. They are not supposed to tamper with any of the electronic equipment or any other thing in the house. They cannot leave the house premises at any time except when permitted to. Physical violence is not allowed in the house. They cannot discuss the nomination process with anyone.[6] They cannot sleep until the lights go off. They cannot talk to anyone outside the smoking area.
  
  Sometimes, the housemates may be nominated for other reasons, such as nomination by a person who has achieved special privileges (via tasks or other things), for breaking rules or something else. If something is very serious, a contestant may be expelled from the house. <br>
